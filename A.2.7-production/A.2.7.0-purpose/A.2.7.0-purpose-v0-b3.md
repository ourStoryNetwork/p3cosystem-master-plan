- Mathematically, it makes sense to track construction schedules based on the moons
  - Nose Breathing Joke: 99.999% of Experts agree that dividing 31, 30, 28/(29?) day months by 7 day weeks instead of dividing 28 day moon cycles by 7 day strengths.
  - NBJ: Everything identifies as an it. Everything's an it, now hush.
- Mythology of trainfarb will be that he reads comics of these great battles in in his universe not realizing they were parallel universes
  - Thinks he'd go crazy if he became a super hero
  - Decides to make music (structure harvest metadata / farm / sit down comic) by making crop circles
  - Crop circles put out music in huniverse, so it sequesters the oge (CO2/ ego/ etc.) into the planet, and then it comes out of 12 different trees as a unique fruit
  - When that fruit falls, it communicates the crop circle pattern that was planted with the local mycelium so the oge sequestering can take place for them automatically while they focus of pursuing their vocation
  - trainfarb works for hu3agency and is teamed up with lp5_ournOrm (nOrm)
  - trainfarb uses the bumbleBee approach - drawing from comedians from different dimensions to create parallel universes focused on creating solutions for the problems they bring up. The laughter from every person who watches a clip puts more energy into the parallel universe. Similar to wormholes where they get weaker with less laughter and can fade out
  - nOrm and trainfarb are each the main character
