  - Problem Statement: The Planet is disconnected from or platforms, so our "2.7.1 Problems" supply chains become focused on solving egoic, narrow focused, problems that don't factor in the negative impact on the same environment that's needed for them to exist. Parasitic problem statements that are destructive to the source of supply chains.

  - Problem Statement: Platforms are disconnected from eachother, so our investment chains incentivize competition through conflicting problem statements that lead to more problems and divisin. Each person is effectiely a parallel reality, but out platforms promote division, so we invest in our ongoing misery since we can't agree on a problem worth solving together.
